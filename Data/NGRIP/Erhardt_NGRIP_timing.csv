# Supplementary data file for: Decadal-scale progression of Dansgaard-Oeschger warming events, by Erhardt et al.
#
# Timing of the transitions in all parameters relative to the ages (in yrs BP, years before 1950) of the GS/GI transitions provided by Rasmussen et al. (2014).
# All values are given as the marignal posterior 50th, 5th and 95th percentile in years.
# Note that the CI for the transition points are with respect to the age stated in the Age column but do not include the uncertainty of that age as given by the maximum counting error (MCE).
#
# For details on the data and methods please refer to the main manuscript and supplementary material
